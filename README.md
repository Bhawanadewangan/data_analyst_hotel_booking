In recent years, City Hotel and Resort hotels have seemed high cancellation rates. Each Hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than-ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels’ primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer business advice to address this problem.
The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have to bring on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

Research Question:-
1.	What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2.	How can we make hotel reservation cancellations better?
3.	How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotion decisions?

Hypothesis:-
1.	More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2.	When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the Highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled Reservations are the largest in the month of August. Whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.
Now, let’s see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.

Let’s check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations. Is it coming from direct or groups? Online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46%   of the clients come from online travel agencies. Whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.
As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not canceled. It clearly proves all the above analysis that the higher Price leads to higher cancellations.

Suggestion:-
1.	Cancellation rates as the price does. In order to prevent cancellation of Reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the Rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide the same Discounts to the customers.
2.	As the ratio of cancellations and not cancellations of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room price on Weekends or on holidays.
3.	In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a Reasonable amount to increase their revenue as cancellation is the highest in this month.
4.	They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly In Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
